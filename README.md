# Scratch-Ye-Heads !!

Programming forcing to Scratch your Heads.....

No worries we got you covered. In this event we will be learning basic programmming while developing
mini-games.

What you waiting for now ?!.... Start Scratching !!!

## Setting Up the Environment ( Estimated Time : 5 mins )
- Create an account on [Scatch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
- Verify your email
- All further tasks will be held on this platform for this contest

## Basics of Scratch ( Estimated Time : 5 mins )
- Checkout the Panels Labelled : `Code`, `Costumes` and `Sound` 
- While the `Code` panel is selected you can look into various differently labelled code blocks on the left : `Motion` , `Sensing` , `Control` etc
- Drag and Drop Blocks of code to set up your logic
- The stage where the output will be shown is already set up and the characters are implemented.
- Just think of the logic and drag-n-drop blocks and progress.

## Output Format:
- Make a word file locally and save as `Scratch`
- Make Sure you save the project as sharable. Click on `Share` at the top to make the project sharable.
- Copy link of the project and save it in the word file with Task1/ Task2/ Task3 as the heading.

## Task 1 : Beetles in Love ( Estimated Time : 25 mins ) 

`A dung beetle couple in love constantly proves that you still can be in love living on shit...`

### Objective
- Make the purple beetle walk the highlighted path and reach the pink beetle

### Project Setup:
- Open this [link](url) and click on `Remix`

### Hints and Clues:
- `Motion`,`Control` and `Sensing` is used
- See those arrows, their color plays an important role in `Sensing`.
- No. of steps of the beetle while moving is to be kept 1 and looped over
- Make Sure the purple beetle is selected in while coding. You can select a particular game element by clicking on the images shown on the bottom right

## Task 2 : Starfish Regeneration ( Estimated Time : 35 mins )

`In the vast oceanic universe starfishes are the stars in the sky of the shore...`

### Objective  
- Make the star-fishes regenerate in the given pattern to solve this task

### Project Setup:
- Open this [link](url) and click on `Remix`

### Hints and Clues:
- For pattern generation you can refer to the following website: [Pyramid-Printing-GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/programs-printing-pyramid-patterns-python/)
- New Variables can be made by going to `Variables` option on the left. Try creating new variables and using them for this task.
- Relative Movement Positions on the X and Y are as follows:

## Task 3 : Practice For FIFA World Cup ( Estimated Time : 55 mins )
`NOW IS ALL: Live your dream, Realise your destiny â€“ and Own the moment`

![](https://github.com/CodingWarrior33/Scratch-Ye-Heads/blob/a08a83549d199775c45466a3fc1cd9683162963b/Project_Deets/fifa.gif)


### Objective
- Help the midfield player achieve different configurations while passing.

### Project Setup:
- Open this [link](url) and click on `Remix`

### Hints and Clues:
- List Functions can be seen in the `Variables` option on the left
- Apply code snippets on the ball
- Variable: `config`, denotes the formation in which the players pass. 
- Lists: 1) `X1` `Y1` 2) `X2` `Y2` 3)  `X3` `Y3` 4) `Config_Name` 
- The Lists `X1` `Y1` and others have to be used together as (x,y) to mark the ball's position.
- Use if else branching to make the player say the configuration name using `Config_Name` list.  
- Use if else branching on the `config` variable.
